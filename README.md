# 🎆 New Year 2026

A playful, interactive New Year greeting experience built as a full-stack web app. It guides you through a dramatic **Temporal Transition Protocol** — a five-stage animated sequence ending with a downloadable "year-end inference report."

> Built with [Mocha](https://getmocha.com)

## ✨ What It Does

Instead of a boring "Happy New Year" card, this app simulates an AI system booting up and processing the transition from 2025 → 2026 with:

- **Boot Sequence** — Animated system initialization messages
- **Year-End Archive** — Reviewing what was left behind
- **Parameter Injection** — Configuring the new year's settings
- **Predictive Simulation** — Running forecasts for 2026
- **Neural Handshake** — Final confirmation of the temporal transition

Each stage unlocks progressively with typewriter animations and timed delays for maximum dramatic effect. At the end, you can download or copy your personalized **Temporal Transition Inference Report**.
